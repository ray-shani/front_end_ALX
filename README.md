The idea you decided to work on.
Within our ALX Hub here in Westlands(The Piano), we have been having an issue when signing in whenever you want to access the co-working. My idea comes in where, instead of a form a user signs in from a website, it shows whether the person using the space is either a Student, an alumnus, or a Staff member. 
This solves the problem of one dependency of Google Sheets and being able to also keep track of the students, staff, community members, and alumni accessing our hubs. This is also crucial to be able to know who might be coming to the hub, not being a student, an alumnus, or a community member.
This maximizes security on who is accessing the hub at what time and when they check out. This also ensures that whoever is using the space is a person within the ALX ecosystem.
What features will your project have?
My project will have a welcome page as well as four buttons asking if you are ;
Student
Staff
Community member
Alumni
Once the user identifies themselves, they will be taken to a page asking them to enter their email, choose the hub they are accessing from, and whether they are checking in or out.
If found within the said field they have chosen they present the confirmation message to the security at the reception or to the receptionist and proceed to do the same.
The API you will be using.
I will be using an API from (https://free-apis.github.io/), where I will be using the emails as a standard for logging in.
Which React components do you think will be required?
I will be using authentication components for the forms asking the user to sign in.
A user profile component is also great; once a user logs in, the status of their account is displayed as a student, staff, community member, or alumnus.
A sign-out button would be nice for the user to sign out once they have checked in.
Your plan for doing the project? You have 5 weeks to complete it.
For the first week, I am in the Idea and planning phase, where I came up with the idea, made plans on how to implement the idea, asked if the idea makes sense, and refined the idea.
For the second week, I plan to work on the designs for my app and how it will work, generally asking for feedback as I go along.
For the third week, I will start implementing the final designs and how to make them work.
For the fourth week, I will still be building and wrapping up the designs.
For the fifth and final week, I will be making my final submissions and making a video explaining my application.
Anything else you feel might be important for planning
Yes, keeping a weekly log of the progress I make as I build along, and maybe sharing it on LinkedIn
